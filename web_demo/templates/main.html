                <h4>About project:</h4>
                <p>CLIPath (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training-Pathology) utilizes the CLIP model from OpenAI to
                    analyze pathology whole slide images and their
                    related reports. The goal is to receive a patch of a WSI image and corresponding query texts, and
                    output the relationship between the queries and input images. </p>
                <p>This analysis can potentially aid in
                    the accurate identification and diagnosis of medical conditions, as well as support medical
                    professionals in their decision-making processes. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of the
                    CLIP model, this project has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of
                    medical imaging analysis.</p>
